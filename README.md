# Likewise

> When one thing is consistently one way while another thing is a certain way, that has indications.  Whether it be true, false, "blue", 25, etc - similarities with consistency are indications (however strong) of correlations.

### Example: Gender Detection

Of the times when the first name is "Mark", how many times is the gender "male", "female", or "other"?  If it turns out that 90% of the time its "male", that is an indication that (at whatever weighting amongst other parameters) people named "Mark" with no gender are "male".

## Design Goals

1.  Be able to determine the likeliness of something, given a set of other things
2.  Be able to discover new similarities
3.  Be able to operate on extremely large data sets, in a distributed environment
